        "question": "In a GitLab CI/CD pipeline deploying an AWS CDK app, what is the primary purpose of the `cdk synth` command?",
        "answers": [
          {"answer": "To directly deploy the infrastructure to AWS."},
          {"answer": "To synthesize the CDK app into a CloudFormation template."},

          {"answer": "To run unit tests for the CDK constructs."}
        ],
        "answer": "To synthesize the CDK app into a CloudFormation template.",
        "explanation": "The `cdk synth` command processes your CDK code and outputs a CloudFormation template, which can then be deployed. It doesn't deploy the resources itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which GitLab CI/CD component is responsible for defining the stages, jobs, and scripts that make up your CI/CD pipeline for deploying the CDK app?",

        "question": "When deploying a frontend service (e.g., a React app) using AWS CDK within a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, which AWS service is commonly used for hosting the static assets?",
        "answers": [
          {"answer": "Amazon EC2"},
          {"answer": "AWS Lambda"},
          {"answer": "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)"},
          {"answer": "Amazon RDS"}
        ],
        "answer": "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)",
        "explanation": "Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and cost-effective service for storing and serving static website content, making it ideal for frontend applications. Often, Amazon CloudFront is used in conjunction with S3 for CDN capabilities."

        "answers": [
          {"answer": "L1 constructs are for frontend, L2 for backend."},
          {"answer": "L1 constructs are high-level abstractions with sensible defaults, while L2 constructs map directly to CloudFormation resources."},
          {"answer": "L2 constructs are high-level abstractions with sensible defaults and convenience methods, while L1 constructs map directly to raw CloudFormation resources."},
          {"answer": "L1 constructs are deprecated, and only L2 constructs should be used."}
        ],
        "answer": "L2 constructs are high-level abstractions with sensible defaults and convenience methods, while L1 constructs map directly to raw CloudFormation resources.",
        "explanation": "L1 (CFN) constructs are auto-generated from CloudFormation specifications, providing a direct mapping. L2 constructs are curated, higher-level abstractions that offer more convenience, sensible defaults, and boilerplate reduction for common patterns."

        ],
        "answer": "IAM Roles with an OIDC identity provider configured for GitLab.",
        "explanation": "Using an IAM OIDC identity provider allows GitLab to securely request temporary credentials from AWS by assuming an IAM Role, eliminating the need for long-lived AWS access keys in GitLab CI/CD variables."
      },
      {
        "question": "During a frontend deployment using CDK and GitLab CI/CD, which typical command would be run *before* `cdk deploy` to prepare the static assets for an S3 bucket deployment?",

          {"answer": "`cdk synth`"}
        ],
        "answer": "`npm run build` or `yarn build`",
        "explanation": "For most JavaScript-based frontends (React, Vue, Angular), a build command like `npm run build` compiles the application into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are then uploaded by the CDK's S3 deployment construct."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the `cdk bootstrap` command primarily used for?",
        "answers": [

        "answer": "To provision initial resources in an AWS environment (account/region) required by the CDK to deploy stacks, like an S3 bucket for assets.",
        "explanation": "`cdk bootstrap` sets up the necessary infrastructure (e.g., an S3 bucket for file assets, IAM roles for deployment) that the CDK needs to perform deployments into a specific AWS account and region."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can you ensure a GitLab CI/CD job only runs on specific runners?",

          {"answer": "By configuring runner IP whitelists in project settings."}
        ],
        "answer": "Assigning `tags` to runners and specifying those tags in the job definition.",
        "explanation": "Runners can be configured with tags (e.g., `docker`, `windows`, `gpu`). Jobs in `.gitlab-ci.yml` can then use the `tags` keyword to specify which runners are eligible to execute them."
      },
      {
        "question": "When deploying a backend API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway with CDK, what does API Gateway primarily provide?",
        "answers": [
          {"answer": "Long-term storage for API request and response data."},

        "answer": "An HTTP endpoint, request routing, authorization, and rate limiting for your Lambda functions.",
        "explanation": "Amazon API Gateway acts as the 'front door' for your Lambda-based APIs, handling incoming HTTP requests, invoking the correct Lambda function, and managing aspects like authentication, authorization, throttling, and caching."
      },
      {
        "question": "If you want to apply a common configuration or transformation to multiple constructs in a CDK stack or app programmatically (e.g., adding a specific tag to all S3 buckets), what CDK feature would be most suitable?",
        "answers": [
          {"answer": "Manually editing the synthesized CloudFormation template."},
          {"answer": "Using CDK Context variables."},

      },
      {
        "question": "In a multi-stage GitLab CI/CD pipeline, how can you define that a job in a later stage should only run after specific jobs in an earlier stage have successfully completed, allowing for parallel execution within stages?",
        "answers": [
          {"answer": "Using the `dependencies` keyword."},

        ],
        "answer": "Using the `needs` keyword with a list of prerequisite jobs.",
        "explanation": "The `needs` keyword creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of job dependencies, allowing jobs to start as soon as their specified predecessor jobs complete, rather than waiting for the entire previous stage to finish."

        ],
        "answer": "To restrict direct access to the S3 bucket, ensuring content is only served through CloudFront.",
        "explanation": "OAI (older) or OAC (newer, recommended) allows CloudFront to securely fetch private content from an S3 bucket on behalf of viewers, while preventing users from bypassing CloudFront and accessing the S3 bucket content directly."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "Passing context variables (`-c key=value`) or using environment variables during `cdk synth/deploy` within GitLab CI jobs, and reading these in the CDK app.",
        "explanation": "CDK apps can be parameterized using context values (from `cdk.json`, command line, or environment variables). GitLab CI jobs can then set these values differently for various deployment environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the significance of the `image` keyword specified at the top level or per-job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`?",

          {"answer": "You must manually pre-upload these to S3 or ECR before running `cdk deploy`."},
          {"answer": "CDK automatically discovers and ignores local files."},
          {"answer": "CDK uses 'Assets' which bundle local files/directories or build Docker images and upload them to a bootstrap S3 bucket or ECR repository during deployment."},
          {"answer": "These files are embedded directly into the CloudFormation template."}
        ],
        "answer": "CDK uses 'Assets' which bundle local files/directories or build Docker images and upload them to a bootstrap S3 bucket or ECR repository during deployment.",
        "explanation": "The CDK's asset model allows you to define Lambda code from a local directory or Docker images from a local Dockerfile. During `cdk deploy`, the CDK CLI packages and uploads these assets to AWS (S3 for files, ECR for images) so CloudFormation can use them."

        ],
        "answer": "In a dedicated test stage in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline, after the service has been deployed to a test/staging environment.",
        "explanation": "Integration tests require the service and its dependencies (like databases or other microservices) to be running. Thus, they are typically executed in the CI/CD pipeline after a deployment to a non-production environment."
